# Python Project Upgrade Notes

## Overview
This document outlines the upgrade performed on the Python Customer Profile Service from Python 3.8 to Python 3.12+.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependency Upgrades

#### pytest
- **Old version**: 6.2.5 (September 2021)
- **New version**: 8.4.2 (September 2025)
- **Reason**: 
  - Security updates
  - Compatibility with Python 3.12+
  - Bug fixes and performance improvements
  - Eliminates deprecation warnings related to AST changes in Python 3.12+

#### requests
- **Old version**: 2.27.1 (January 2022)
- **New version**: 2.32.5 (August 2025)
- **Reason**:
  - Security updates
  - Python 3.14 support
  - Bug fixes for SSL context handling
  - Improved URL credential handling

### 2. Python Version Updates

Updated minimum Python version from 3.8 to 3.12+ in:
- `main.py` - Updated compatibility comment
- `README.md` - Updated service description
- `technical-documentation.md` - Updated runtime requirements
- Root `README.md` - Updated table and installation instructions

### 3. Security Review

All upgraded dependencies were checked against the GitHub Advisory Database:
- **pytest 8.4.2**: No known vulnerabilities
- **requests 2.32.5**: No known vulnerabilities

## Benefits of the Upgrade

1. **Security**: Latest versions include all security patches
2. **Performance**: Modern versions include performance improvements
3. **Compatibility**: Full support for Python 3.12 features
4. **Stability**: Bug fixes from 3+ years of development
5. **Future-proofing**: Better positioned for Python 3.13+ migration

## Testing

### Pre-upgrade Test Results
All 11 tests passed with the old dependencies (pytest 6.2.5, requests 2.27.1):
- Root endpoint test ✓
- Health check test ✓
- Customer retrieval tests ✓
- Customer update tests ✓
- Error handling tests ✓

However, there were 336 deprecation warnings related to Python 3.12 compatibility issues in pytest 6.2.5.

### Post-upgrade Testing
To verify the upgrade with the new dependencies, run:

```bash
cd legacy-python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest test_main.py -v
```

Expected result: All 11 tests should pass without deprecation warnings.

## Rollback Procedure

If issues arise, revert to the previous versions:

```bash
# Restore old requirements.txt
cat > requirements.txt << EOF
pytest==6.2.5
requests==2.27.1
EOF

# Reinstall
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
None expected. The code uses standard library features that are compatible across Python 3.8-3.12.

### Compatibility
- The upgraded versions maintain backward compatibility with existing test suite
- No code changes required beyond dependency versions
- All existing functionality preserved

## Next Steps

1. Verify tests pass with new dependencies
2. Monitor application behavior in development
3. Consider additional modernizations:
   - Add type hints throughout codebase
   - Update to use newer Python 3.12 features (e.g., match/case statements)
   - Add pre-commit hooks for code quality
   - Implement automated dependency updates (Dependabot)
