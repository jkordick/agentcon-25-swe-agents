## Premium Calculation Logic

The API uses simple if-else logic to calculate premiums:

1. **Base Rate**: Determined by vehicle type
2. **Age Multiplier**: Applied based on driver age category
3. **Special Conditions**:
   - Young motorcycle riders (under 21): +50% premium
   - Senior truck drivers (over 70): +20% premium
   - Prime age car drivers (30-50): -10% discount
4. **Status Classification**:
   - Premium > $2,500: "peasant" status
   - Premium â‰¤ $2,500: "premium" status
